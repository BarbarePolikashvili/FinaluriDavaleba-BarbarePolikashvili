        <h2>üìå How I Made My First Website</h2>
        <p>
          This was my very first time working with code, and everything felt
          completely new to me. I had never used HTML or CSS before, so at the
          beginning, even writing simple tags felt confusing. But step by
          step,with the help of my teacher, I started to understand how coding
          works and how websites are built. As I practiced, I learned how to
          structure a page using HTML and make it look good with CSS. One of the
          biggest challenges was making sure everything looked right on
          different screen sizes, especially mobile. That‚Äôs when I learned about
          things like flexbox and media queries, which really helped. In the
          end, seeing my own website come together and actually work was one of
          the most satisfying moments of the whole project. It made me feel
          confident and excited to learn more about web design and development.

        <h2>üìå The Importance of HTML Tags</h2>
        <p>
          HTML isn‚Äôt just code ‚Äì it defines structure and meaning. Using
          semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and
          <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> made my site more accessible and
          understandable ‚Äî for both users and search engines.

        <h2>üìå How I Used AI in My Blog</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, AI played a supportive role in helping me
          solve problems and improve my code. I mostly used ChatGPT while
          working on my Contact Me page, because I wanted it to function
          properly and meet specific conditions. For example, I wanted to make
          sure that: All input fields were required before the form could be
          submitted. The email field specifically required an ‚Äú@‚Äù symbol to be
          considered valid. The layout worked well on all screen sizes
          (responsive design). Even though I had a basic idea of what I wanted,
          AI helped me figure out the correct HTML attributes and form
          validation logic, and even guided me on how to style it properly. It
          saved me time and made the process smoother, while still letting me
          learn and understand the code myself.
